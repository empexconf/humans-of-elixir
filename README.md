# Site

The new EMPEX site, now in Elixir!

## Install

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && yarn install`
- Install Sass/Compass with `gem install compass`

If the css isn't building try `gem uninstall compass sass` and then re-running just `gem install compass`.

## Development

- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
